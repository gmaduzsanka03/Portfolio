# Profile Image Setup Instructions

## How to Add Your Professional Portrait

### Step 1: Prepare Your Image
1. **Save your professional portrait** as a high-quality image
2. **Recommended format**: JPG, PNG, or WebP
3. **Recommended size**: 400x400 pixels or larger (square aspect ratio works best)
4. **File name**: `profile-image.jpg`

### Step 2: Add to Portfolio
1. **Navigate to**: `public/images/` directory in your portfolio
2. **Replace** the placeholder file `profile-image.jpg` with your actual image
3. **Keep the same filename**: `profile-image.jpg`

### Step 3: Verify
1. **Start your development server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Visit**: `http://localhost:3003`
3. **Check**: Your image should appear in:
   - Hero section (top of the page) - circular profile image
   - About section - larger circular profile image

### Image Locations in Your Portfolio:
- **Hero Section**: Top of the page, 160x160px circular image
- **About Section**: Right side, 192x192px circular image

### Fallback:
If the image fails to load, the system will automatically show "WGM" initials in a colored circle.

### Tips for Best Results:
- Use a high-resolution image (at least 400x400 pixels)
- Ensure good lighting and professional appearance
- Square aspect ratio works best for circular display
- Consider using a professional headshot with a clean background

Your professional portrait will now be displayed prominently throughout your portfolio! ðŸŽ‰
